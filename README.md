# Exercism Elixir Track

This project is dedicated to the Elixir track on Exercism. Each exercise from the track is represented by a file in the `lib` directory. 

The naming convention for the files is as follows: each file starts with "a", followed by a number that represents the order in which the exercise was solved, and then the name of the exercise as it is named by Exercism. 

For example, a file named `a001_hello_world.ex` would represent the first exercise solved, which is the "Hello, World!" exercise.

While there is no single prescribed order for tackling the exercises on Exercism, I have chosen to approach them in a way that generally progresses in difficulty. The number in the file name represents this personal progression. 

Elixir is a relatively approachable functional programming language. Whether you decide to use it or not, learning Elixir allows you to familiarize yourself with constructs commonly found in functional languages, such as:
- Pattern matching
- Recursion
- Immutability

Mastering these concepts often provides additional tools for problem-solving, enriching your programming skill set regardless of the language you primarily use.

For those exercises that are not part of a track, tests are included within the exercise itself. I have copied these tests into a separate file named after the exercise. Therefore, you can use this repository to conveniently have the tests ready to use alongside your own solutions.
